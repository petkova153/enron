Enron. Identifying fraud.
This project takes a closer look on the Enron fraud case revealed towards the end of 2001.
Background.
In its best years Enron was defined by many as innovative, ahead of its time, daring and
revolutionary.
The company was formed in 1985 following a merger between Houston Natural Gas Co. and
Omaha-based InterNorth Inc. As the chief executive officer (CEO) of Houston Natural Gas,
Kenneth Lay became Enron's CEO and chairman, and quickly rebranded Enron into an energy
trader and supplier. Enron took great advantage of the deregulation of the energy markets which
allowed companies to place bets on future prices.
What allowed Enron to flourish was the dot-com bubble at the end of the 90s when the bubble was
in full swing, and the Nasdaq hit 5,000. Revolutionary internet stocks were being overvalued and
regulators simply accepted spiking share prices as the new normal.
